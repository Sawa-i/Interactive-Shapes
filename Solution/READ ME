Hi, Following are the briefings:-

NEW FILES CREATED:-
 > Shape.java
 > ShapesManager.java
 
 FILES MODIFIED:-
  > WindowCreator.java
  > CustomPanel.java
  > CustomWindow.java
  
  
  TASKS DONE:-
   > All Shapes ( circle, square, rectangle, quadrilateral ( with 3 constructors) ) were completed along with their relevant functions.
   	>> ShapeManager is at "WindowCreator.java" and all creation of Shape objects and their addition to ShapeManager is to be done through 'createShapes()' user defined function there.
   	
    > Also the Tasks given as Excercise were also done.
    
    
    PS: ~ I would be commenting The Excercise task part in "CustomPanel.java" while letting the other be non-commented, 
	
	~ Go through Code and if any query.... do Contact ;)
    
    
    
NOTE: """""""""""""" I used UBUNTU hence """""""""""""""""""""""
			1) "javac WindowCreator.java" to compile
			2) "java WindowCreator" to run
